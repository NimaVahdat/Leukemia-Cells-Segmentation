# Leukemia-Cells-Segmentation
## Leukemia cells picture segmentation using Genetic and Simulated Annealing algorithms.

In this project Genetic and Simulated Annealing algorithm    separately implemented from scratch to find 3, 4 or 5 common colors in pictures to recolor them and apply segmentation on them.
